 * Rivers do not drinks their own water
 * Trees do not eat their own fruit
 * The sun does not shine on itself and 
 * Flowers do not spread their fragrance for themselves
 * Living for others is a rule of nature. We are born to help each other
 * No matter how difficult it is... Life is good when you are happy;
 * But much better when others are happy because of you.
 * 
 * -Pope Francis
